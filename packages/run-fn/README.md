# Run-fn

Collections of useful CLI functions

## Install

`npm i -g run-fn`

After installation, a binary `run` becomes available for CLI use.

## Commands

### angular

Expected structure: 

`/repos/ng-foo`

`/repos/foo` - process.cwd

It takes Angular dependencies from the `ng-foo` folder in relation to `process.cwd`. Then it updates dependencies versions in `${process.cwd}/package.json`.

This way, if `ng-foo` contains `ng new ng-foo` with updated `@angular/cli`, then the new dependencies can be merged to other Angular apps.

### bump

> `run bump minor` would trigger `npm publish minor&&npm publish&&git push`
> `run bump` would trigger `npm publish patch&&npm publish&&git push`

### d/de

> run de
> run d message of commit

It adds all changed files, makes a commit and finally runs `git push`

### dep/depx

It updateds all dependencies. `depx` means that update is confirmed by the user.

### read

> run read [foo]

It runs git clone command and remove `.git` folder
If `foo` is passed the repo will be placed in `foo` folder.

Also if file path contains `to-read` then it will make a commit afterwards.

### read done

> run read done foo

It will move `foo` folder to `_DONE` folder

It clones `selfrefactor` foo repo and removes `.git` folder afterwards.

### Lint file

> run lintfile foo.js

It runs ESLint with fix flag over `foo.js`.

Linting depends on several factors:

- if ends with 'componenent.js' - React lint
- if includes '.spec.js' - Jest lint
- if ends with '.js' - default Javascript lint
- if ends with '.ts' - Run `tslint` command with the settings found in `process.cwd()`

### Lint current folder

> run lintfolder

It lints all the Javascript and Typescript files in the current directory and its subfolders.
